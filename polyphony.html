                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-7 col-12">
                        <p>There are many musicians that are looking to start a band or find other people to play music with, whether it be professionally or casually, and finding other musicians can be a challenge for some. Between genre preferences, location, and personality, there are many variables that factor into finding musicians that can gel well together. Using my experiences as a musician as a guide, I decided to create Polyphony, a musician/band-finder app that can help musicians and bands find and connect with each other, whether it be locally or worldwide.
                        </p>
                    </div> 
                        <br>

                        <div class="col-5">
                        <h4 class="case-study-header">02. Research</h4>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-7">
                        <p>
                            I wanted Polyphony’s audience to focus on musicians, especially since the purpose of the app is to serve as a hub to connect with other musicians for future collaboration (or even networking). While the app is open to musicians of all genres and ages, <span class="highlight">the app would most likely appeal to musicians within genres that are group-centric (e.g. rock, country, jazz, etc.), and would mostly be used by teenagers and young adults (18 to 35). </span>With this in mind, I listed five goals I envisioned for the app.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="case-study-header2">User Goals</h4> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be able to search for musicians and filter by location and personal characteristics (e.g. instrument, age, sex/gender, preferred genre, level of experience)</li>
                            <li>Search for bands and filter by location, genre, experience, and open slots by instrument</li>
                            <li>Post and respond to musician/band want ads requesting musicians or to join a band</li>
                            <li>Create unique user profiles as a hub to find information about a specific user and to facilitate messaging between users</li>
                            <li>Upload samples of tracks, videos, and pictures for users to showcase their work so others can make more informed decisions on who they would most align with artistically or personality-wise</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            I then decided to conduct user research; because of the tight deadline I had for research, I decided to use an online survey, which would help me reach many people in a short amount of time. When creating my survey, my primary goal was to ask participants which features they would want to see in Polyphony, including features I found in competitor apps. I also gave them the chance to write out features that they’d want that weren’t mentioned. There were 20 participants.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also conducted a competitive analysis of other apps that were similar, either directly (i.e. other musician-finder apps) or indirectly (i.e. social media/connection apps). <span class="highlight">The main takeaway I found was that they all had great features that weren’t combined into one app; this is where I felt Polyphony had potential value within the market.</span>
                        </p>

                            When I began moving to the design phase of the project, I knew I wanted to create a distinct visual identity for the app. While my original vision started as being more image-centric with artwork inspired by photomontage album covers, I found this wasn’t practical for the app from an organizational and audience standpoint. I then decided that the best way to reflect my original idea was to incorporate album artwork influences into the typography and color scheme.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For my font choices, I went through <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/in/2/formats/72/album-art" class="case-study-link" target="_blank">a list of album artwork and the fonts they used.</a> I chose a display typeface, Microgramma D Extended, for the headers, taken from the Tame Impala album ‘Currents’; I felt that its look fit with the theme of using technology to connect with others. For the body copy, I originally chose Helvetica, which was one of the most commonly used fonts out of the album artwork I researched. However, I eventually went with Roboto, a font which is very similar in look, but in my opinion looked better within the app combined with Microgramma D.
                        </p>

                            I decided to choose a two-color scheme that would be used throughout the app. I felt that this represented the idea of multiple people coming together, which fits with the social aspect of Polyphony.
